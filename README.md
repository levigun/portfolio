# MY PORTFOLIO

## Description

My name is Theresa Levina Gunawan and this is my first attempt in making an online portfolio. It has my basic information with a bit of my personality in the theme.

It consists of some basic and advanced CSS style but, it doesn't have a porfessional look yet. I am looking forward to creating a better edition of this portfolio after learning more coding knowledge in the coming future. Stay tuned!
